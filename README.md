### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning engineer and an aspiring indie-hacker from India. I love working with data and code to create amazing solutions for real-world problems. 

- ðŸ”­ At Gojek, I'm part of the team that builds scalable and robust data pipelines and ML models for various use cases. It's a great place to learn and grow as a data professional. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm interested in learning how to build full-stack apps that can leverage the power of ML. I think it's a valuable skill to have as an indie-hacker who wants to launch their own products.
- ðŸ¤” One thing I struggle with sometimes is shipping things faster. I tend to get stuck on details or perfectionism and lose sight of the bigger picture. If you have any tips or resources on how to overcome this, please let me know!
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saikatkrdey) or [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/saikatkumardey) if you want to chat or collaborate on something. I'm always happy to connect with like-minded people.
- âš¡ A fun fact about me is that I play the piano in my free time. It's a relaxing and creative hobby that helps me unwind after a long day.

If you want to read more about my thoughts and experiences on data science, machine learning and programming, you can check out my [blog](https://saikatkumardey.com/). I write about various topics that interest me or challenge me in these domains.
